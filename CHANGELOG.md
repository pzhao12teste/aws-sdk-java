    - Read Replicas for Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL now support Multi-AZ deployments.Amazon RDS Read Replicas enable you to create one or more read-only copies of your database instance within the same AWS Region or in a different AWS Region. Updates made to the source database are asynchronously copied to the Read Replicas. In addition to providing scalability for read-heavy workloads, you can choose to promote a Read Replica to become standalone a DB instance when needed.Amazon RDS Multi-AZ Deployments provide enhanced availability for database instances within a single AWS Region. With Multi-AZ, your data is synchronously replicated to a standby in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, minimizing disruption to your applications.You can now combine Read Replicas with Multi-AZ as part of a disaster recovery strategy for your production databases. A well-designed and tested plan is critical for maintaining business continuity after a disaster. Since Read Replicas can also be created in different regions than the source database, your Read Replica can be promoted to become the new production database in case of a regional disruption.You can also combine Read Replicas with Multi-AZ for your database engine upgrade process. You can create a Read Replica of your production database instance and upgrade it to a new database engine version. When the upgrade is complete, you can stop applications, promote the Read Replica to a standalone database instance and switch over your applications. Since the database instance is already a Multi-AZ deployment, no additional steps are needed.For more information, see the Amazon RDS User Guide.

  - ### Features
    - Resource Groups Tagging APIs can help you organize your resources and enable you to simplify resource management, access management, and cost allocation.

## __AWS Storage Gateway__
  - ### Features
    - File gateway mode in AWS Storage gateway provides access to objects in S3 as files on a Network File System (NFS) mount point. Once a file share is created, any changes made externally to the S3 bucket will not be reflected by the gateway. Using the cache refresh feature in this update, the customer can trigger an on-demand scan of the keys in their S3 bucket and refresh the file namespace cached on the gateway. It takes as an input the fileShare ARN and refreshes the cache for only that file share. Additionally there is new functionality on file gateway that allows you configure what squash options they would like on their file share, this allows a customer to configure their gateway to not squash root permissions. This can be done by setting options in NfsOptions for CreateNfsFileShare and UpdateNfsFileShare APIs.

## __Amazon EC2__
  - ### Features
    - Customers can now tag their Amazon EC2 Instances and Amazon EBS Volumes at the time of their creation. You can do this from the EC2 Instance launch wizard or through the RunInstances or CreateVolume APIs. By tagging resources at the time of creation, you can eliminate the need to run custom tagging scripts after resource creation. In addition, you can now set resource-level permissions on the CreateVolume, CreateTags, DeleteTags, and the RunInstances APIs. This allows you to implement stronger security policies by giving you more granular control over which users and groups have access to these APIs. You can also enforce the use of tagging and control what tag keys and values are set on your resources. When you combine tag usage and resource-level IAM policies together, you can ensure your instances and volumes are properly secured upon creation and achieve more accurate cost allocation reporting. These new features are provided at no additional cost.

This is done by creating Nfs file shares using existing APIs CreateNfsFileShare. Using the feature in this update, the customer can restrict the clients that have read/write access to the gateway by specifying the list of clients as a list of IP addresses or CIDR blocks. This list can be specified using the API CreateNfsFileShare while creating new file shares, or UpdateNfsFileShare while update existing file shares. To find out the list of clients that have access, the existing API DescribeNfsFileShare will now output the list of clients that have access.

      ```
      _NB: This should only be used if a custom endpoint is required, the recommended approach for configuring a client is via set/withRegion on the builder_
    - Bundled dependency of AWS SDK jar available as a new maven module 'aws-java-sdk-bundle'. This module includes all service and dependent JARs with third-party libraries relocated to different namespaces.

  - ### Deprecations
    - Deprecating `com.amazonaws.regions.Region.createClient`, clients should be created via their builder implementation for example:

      ```java
      AmazonSNSClientBuilder.standard().withRegion(region).build();
      ```
    - Deprecating client constructors & mutation methods on clients (eg `setRegion`) in favor of creating a client via the client builders. The following mechanism for creating clients is deprecated:

      ```java
      AmazonSNSClient client = new AmazonSNSClient(clientConfiguration); //client constructor is deprecated
      client.setRegion(RegionUtils.getRegion("us-east-1"));              //mutating the client via setRegion is deprecated
      ```

      Clients should now be constructed using the builder:

      ```java
      AmazonSNS client = AmazonSNSClientBuilder.standard().withClientConfiguration(clientConfiguration).withRegion("us-east-1").build();
      ```

      ```java
      TransferManager tm = TransferManagerBuilder.standard().withS3Client(s3Client).build();
      ```

## __Amazon DynamoDB__
  - ### Deprecations
    - Deprecating [waitForActiveOrDelete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForActiveOrDelete--) and [waitForAllActiveOrDelete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForAllActiveOrDelete--) methods in Table class which can give incorrect results if they are called immediatedly after creating or deleting a table. This is due to dynamoDb operations being eventually consistent and might take a few seconds to propagate the new status. Use [waitForActive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForActive--) and [waitForDelete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/dynamodbv2/document/Table.html#waitForDelete--) instead.
