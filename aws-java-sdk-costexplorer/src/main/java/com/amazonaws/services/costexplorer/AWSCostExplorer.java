 * Interface for accessing AWS Cost Explorer.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.costexplorer.AbstractAWSCostExplorer} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The Cost Explorer API allows you to programmatically query your cost and usage data. You can query for aggregated
 * data such as total monthly costs or total daily usage. You can also query for granular data, such as the number of
 * daily write operations for DynamoDB database tables in your production environment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Service Endpoint
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Cost Explorer API provides the following endpoint:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * https://ce.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
